- What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

	I was a little shaky with pull requests and merging in my GitHub repository, just because I had very little experience doing it before. 

- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

	I found out that I had accidentally been creating repositories inside repositories out of a habit that a developer at my old job had trained me to do. Now I know better! :)

- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

	Unfortunately, I did not have a pair to work with during my GPS, but my guide was very helpful in helping me explain why I was typing what I was typing in Terminal, as well as giving me some shortcuts (such as "git co"). 

- What still confuses you about Git?

	While I know what I'm supposed to type to move a file through untracked, staged, and committed, I guess I don't really know *how* it's being done. I just know that it's happening and it works.

- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

	Again, I unfortunately wasn't able to pair with anyone during my session. It was nice getting one-on-one help with an instructor though. :)
